# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to CellForge.

## Ground rules
- Keep changes focused and well-described.
- Do not overwrite historical files in `archive/`.
- For hardware changes, create a new revision folder rather than editing past revisions.

## Pull requests
- Describe what changed and why.
- Include photos/screenshots for hardware changes where possible.
- Keep Arduino IDE compatibility for `firmware/arduino-nano/ASCD_Nano`.

## Issues
- Include board revision, firmware version, and clear reproduction steps.
